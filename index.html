        <p class="lead col-md-6">“There is no such thing as a weird human being. It’s just that some people require more understanding than others.” ― Tom Robbins <br><br>
          The first step towards change is always the most difficult, especially when that step involves coming to a stranger’s office in hopes that she will relieve your suffering. However, I try my best to reduce the fears patient’s experience about therapy by offering compassionate and non-judgemental care for all those in need while always maintaining a positive attitude along with a good sense of humor. I utilize evidence-based techniques to provide brief, structured treatments that have demonstrated proven results. I do not feel that anyone needs to live in suffering and I hope the services I offer may help reduce your distress and increase your well-being.
        <p class="lead col-md-6">I provide culturally competent treatment to all those in need and offer services on a sliding scale based on my client’s income.

        <p class="lead col-md-6">I am a psychotherapist currently pursuing my Marriage and Family Therapist Licence. I recently graduated from San Jose State University where my supervisors strongly encouraged and trained me in evidence-based practices. I am knowledgeable about the effective treatments for all psychological disorders including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, complicated grief, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety.</p>
        <p class="lead col-md-6">I worked at The San Francisco Suicide Prevention (SFSP) and a domestic violence shelter, where I mastered my skills in crisis intervention. In addition, I worked with adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities for several years, advocating for my clients’ needs and assisting them in obtaining full-time employment as well as independent living. I trained in an elementary school, where I helped relieve the distress of the children I worked with while incorporating their families and teachers. I learned the importance of including the system around the individual in order to achieve the best results.
          <br><br>I have received training in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). All of these treatments have profound empirical evidence to support their ability to lead to positive outcomes.</p>
